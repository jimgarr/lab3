# Lab Report 2
## Description
This lab report includes ceating a Web Server called StringServer which uses the path input from URL to add Strings to the page. It also includes how to identify bugs and what types of inputs cause these bugs. 
## Part 1
Below is the code for String Server. ![String Server Code](labReport2Code.png)
Below is the first instance of using /add-message in the path for the Web Server. I used /add-message?s=Working! which displays Working! on the Web Server. ![Web Server img1](labReport2Website1.png)
The first method that is called is Server.start(port, new Handler()) which initially starts the Server. From here, nothing is shown on the website until the path is modified with /add-message and the message the user wants to write in the query. The String variable inputs initially is empty and is added to when the user gives it input. In my above example, I used "Working!" which calls public String handleRequest(URI url). The method takes the website URL and then uses a series of if else statements to determine what is included in the path. In this example, the else staement including url.getPath().equals("/add-message") is run. getPath() takes the path part of the URL and using .equal, compares whether the path includes "/add-message". Since it does, the String array called parameters gets initialized by the method url.getQuery().split("="). This takes the query and splits it into two parts, the first being before the = and the second being after the =. From here, assuming that the query began with s, the message after = is added to the variable inputs. Since the Web Server has to keep track of each message that is inputted, inputs is given a newline and then adds the new message.
